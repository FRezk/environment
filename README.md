# Environment
Standard Java Web environment for REST APIs development.

## What is it?
This is a Java project with all set up ready to develop Rest Services. There's an example, following the main J2EE design patterns, which can be followed as a template to create real services.

```
A maven project, based on Spring Web MVC, with JPA and Hibernate libs included 
ready to connect a database, developed on Tomcat v9.0 .
```

This project can be used as a template for students and professionals which have to begin a Java Environment to develop Rest Services using Spring MVC.

Tip: Just remember to change the application server dependency, on the main pom.xml, to fit on your application server. In case of students, its ready to run on a Tomcat v9.0. For professionals, you're probably not using Tomcat.

### How to use?
It's very simple to use!

```
